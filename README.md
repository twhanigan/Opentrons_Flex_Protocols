# Opentrons_Flex_Protocols
Opentrons Flex protocols written using the Python api v2
All the protocols run the record_video.py python script as a subprocess to initiate recording during the run. The video is dated and timestamped. record_video.py is saved in the jupyter notebooks folder on the opentrons flex.
